I plan to help people in terms of prevention from consuming or Buying counterfeit drugs or medical equipment in order to eradicate them from the market with the help of our App/website running on blockchain ML/AI technology and Image processing techniques. This will help the people to achieve information regarding the medicine which they are buying with the help of our app that will show all the necessary details such as it’s constituting salts, side effects, age barrier, consumption quantity, MRP and Expiry date in tern spreading awareness among the people about the drugs they are using. I plan to do this by creating a database for all medicines clinically available. When the consumer scans the medicine or upload the image of medicine or its package, our database will run tests which include, image comparison, since the counterfeit ones tend to have some difference in the structure, logo, colour, packaging and whether it is approved by the drugs association or not. Blockchain technique will keep track of the route of the medicine as to from where they originate in order to help eradicate counterfeit drugs from the market. Apart from this, we tend to give a feedback section so that any unnoted characteristics of the medicine can be added to the database and further consumers could be told about them in order to make the people aware of the choice of drug they make
